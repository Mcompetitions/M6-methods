# M6-methods

R and Python scripts to:

i) Download historical prices data for the M6 universe assets 
Here we provide an example when the free-to-use Yahoo API is employed, but other APIs may be more appropriate for collecting historical data. 
Currently, the M6 is fetching data using the API provided by https://eodhistoricaldata.com/.

ii) Compute RPS and IR for a given evaluation period

An excel file providing an example of how the RPS and IR can be computed for a dummy submission (similar to the template of the competition). 
The example is given for the first quarter of the M6 and the pilot phase.
